                        Captain America is more than a superhero; he is a symbol
                        of justice, perseverance, and the enduring fight for
                        what is right. His stories often explore themes of duty,
                        patriotism, and the moral complexities of leadership and
                        heroism.

                        portrayal in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) brought

                        status as a champion of justice and liberty.</p>
